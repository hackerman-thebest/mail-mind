# Story 3.4: Marketing & Documentation Alignment

Status: Ready

## Story

As a product owner,
I want marketing claims aligned with actual security implementation,
so that we maintain user trust and avoid false advertising.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1: Update Marketing Messaging** - Change "Absolute Privacy" to "Local-First Privacy" across all marketing materials (README, website copy, product descriptions)
2. **AC2: Comprehensive Security Documentation** - SECURITY.md exists and documents encryption (3.1), prompt injection defense (3.2), SQL injection prevention (3.3), and model verification (3.3)
3. **AC3: Privacy Policy** - Create privacy-policy.md explaining what data is collected, encrypted, stored locally, and never uploaded to cloud
4. **AC4: README Security Features Section** - Update README.md with comprehensive security features checklist showing implemented Story 3.1-3.3 features
5. **AC5: Security FAQ** - Create security-faq.md answering common user questions: "Is my data encrypted?", "Where is data stored?", "What about Outlook storage?"
6. **AC6: Document Known Limitations** - Transparently document security boundaries: what IS protected (database) vs what IS NOT (Outlook storage, memory, screen)
7. **AC7: Security Roadmap** - Add future security improvements to SECURITY.md: macOS/Linux encryption, key rotation, HSM support
8. **AC8: Security Badges** - Add visual indicators to README: "üîí SQLCipher Encrypted", "üõ°Ô∏è Prompt Injection Defense", "üîê Local-First Privacy"

## Dev Notes

### Problem Statement

**Marketing Misalignment:** Current marketing claims "Absolute Privacy" but implementation has realistic security boundaries. After completing Stories 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, we now have:
- ‚úÖ Database encryption (SQLCipher)
- ‚úÖ Prompt injection defense
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention
- ‚úÖ Model checksum verification

However, security boundaries exist:
- ‚ùå Outlook email storage (outside our control)
- ‚ùå Application memory while running
- ‚ùå Screen capture
- ‚ùå Administrator-level access

**Need:** Honest, transparent messaging that builds trust by clearly stating what IS and ISN'T protected.

### Current State Analysis

**README.md Status:**
- ‚úÖ Has "Security Features" section documenting Story 3.1 (Database Encryption)
- ‚úÖ Mentions "Local-First Privacy" in some places
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Still references "Absolute Privacy" in tagline
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Stories 3.2 and 3.3 security features
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing security badges and visual indicators

**SECURITY.md Status (Verified 2025-10-16):**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive database encryption documentation (Story 3.1)
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention documentation (Story 3.3)
- ‚úÖ Model checksum verification documentation (Story 3.3)
- ‚úÖ Prompt injection defense documentation (Story 3.2)
- ‚úÖ Threat model with mitigated/not mitigated sections
- ‚úÖ Security roadmap section
- ‚úÖ Vulnerability reporting process
- ‚úÖ Version 1.1.0, Last Updated: 2025-10-16

**Missing Documentation:**
- ‚ùå Privacy policy (privacy-policy.md)
- ‚ùå Security FAQ (security-faq.md)
- ‚ùå Security badges in README
- ‚ùå Comprehensive "What's Protected" comparison

### Documentation Architecture

**File Structure:**
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (project root) - Main entry point, security overview
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SECURITY.md (project root) - Technical security architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ privacy-policy.md - User-facing privacy policy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security-faq.md - Common security questions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGELOG.md - Document documentation updates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ stories/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ story-3.1.md - Database encryption (reference)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ story-3.2.md - Prompt injection defense (reference)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ story-3.3.md - SQL injection + model verification (reference)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ story-3.4.md - This story
```

**Documentation Hierarchy:**
1. **README.md** - First impression, high-level security overview with badges
2. **SECURITY.md** - Technical deep-dive for developers and security reviewers
3. **privacy-policy.md** - Legal/user-facing data handling explanation
4. **security-faq.md** - User-friendly Q&A for common concerns

### Messaging Guidelines

**Preferred Terms:**
- ‚úÖ "Local-First Privacy" - Accurate, transparent
- ‚úÖ "Your AI, Your Data, Your Rules" - Empowering, honest
- ‚úÖ "Never Leaves Your Computer" - Clear, specific
- ‚úÖ "Industry-standard encryption" - Professional, realistic

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå "Absolute Privacy" - Unrealistic, impossible to guarantee
- ‚ùå "100% Secure" - No system is 100% secure
- ‚ùå "Unhackable" - False claim
- ‚ùå "Military-grade encryption" - Meaningless marketing speak

**Honest Limitations:**
- "Email content remains in Outlook's storage, which may not be encrypted by default"
- "Encryption protects database file at rest, not application runtime"
- "For comprehensive protection, use full-disk encryption (BitLocker)"
- "Administrator-level access can extract DPAPI keys"

### Testing Standards

**Documentation Quality Checks:**
- [ ] All claims verifiable against implementation
- [ ] No instances of "Absolute Privacy" remain
- [ ] All code examples tested and accurate
- [ ] Cross-references and links work correctly
- [ ] Consistent terminology throughout
- [ ] Security limitations clearly documented
- [ ] Privacy policy complete and accurate
- [ ] Security FAQ covers 8+ common questions

**User Review:**
- [ ] Non-technical user can understand privacy policy
- [ ] Security FAQ answers actual user questions
- [ ] README security section is clear and non-technical
- [ ] SECURITY.md is comprehensive for developers

### Project Structure Notes

**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.1 (Database Encryption) - ‚úÖ Complete, documented
- Story 3.2 (Prompt Injection Defense) - ‚úÖ Complete, documented
- Story 3.3 (SQL Injection + Model Verification) - ‚úÖ Complete, documented
- No code changes required for this story (documentation only)

**Integration Points:**
- README.md links to SECURITY.md for technical details
- SECURITY.md references privacy-policy.md for data handling
- security-faq.md links to both README and SECURITY.md
- All documentation references actual story files for implementation details

**Files to Create:**
- docs/privacy-policy.md (new file)
- docs/security-faq.md (new file)

**Files to Modify:**
- README.md (update security section, add badges)
- SECURITY.md (verify completeness, update roadmap)
- CHANGELOG.md (document documentation updates)

### Security Considerations

**Trust and Transparency:**
- Honest security claims build long-term user trust
- Transparency about limitations is more trustworthy than overstatements
- Clear documentation of what IS and ISN'T protected sets realistic expectations

**Threats Mitigated by This Story:**
- ‚úÖ False advertising / misleading claims
- ‚úÖ User confusion about security boundaries
- ‚úÖ Reputation damage from overpromising
- ‚úÖ Legal liability from inaccurate privacy claims

**User Impact:**
- Users can make informed decisions about data sensitivity
- Clear limitations help users understand when NOT to use MailMind
- Transparent documentation builds trust in the product
- Professional security documentation attracts privacy-conscious users
