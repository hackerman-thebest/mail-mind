# Story 1.4: Priority Classification System

**Epic:** Epic 1 - AI-Powered Email Intelligence
**Story ID:** 1.4
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
**Status:** Draft
**Created:** 2025-10-13

## Story Description

As a user, I need emails automatically classified by priority (High/Medium/Low) so that I can focus on what matters most.

## Business Value

This story builds upon Story 1.3's basic priority classification to create an intelligent, learning system:
- Accurate priority classification helps users triage 100-200 emails/day efficiently
- Visual priority indicators (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”µ) enable instant inbox scanning
- Learning from user corrections improves accuracy over time (target: >85% within 30 days)
- Manual override capability gives users control while improving the system
- Priority-based inbox organization reduces cognitive load and email stress
- Adaptive classification considers sender importance and historical patterns

Without this story, priority classification is static. This adds personalized learning and continuous improvement.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Priority Classification with Confidence
- [ ] Classify all emails as High, Medium, or Low priority
- [ ] Include confidence score (0.0 - 1.0) for each classification
- [ ] High confidence threshold: >0.8 for actionable recommendations
- [ ] Priority determination factors:
  - Urgency keywords (ASAP, urgent, deadline, critical, emergency)
  - Sender importance (executives, direct manager, VIP contacts)
  - Action requirements (please review, need your input, waiting on you)
  - Explicit deadlines and time constraints
  - Thread context (reply to high-priority thread inherits priority)
- [ ] Confidence increases with user correction history for similar patterns

### AC2: High Priority Detection Logic
- [ ] Urgency indicators: "ASAP", "urgent", "critical", "emergency", "immediately"
- [ ] Action-required phrases: "need your approval", "requires your input", "waiting for you"
- [ ] Deadline detection: "by EOD", "due tomorrow", "deadline Friday"
- [ ] Executive senders: Configurable VIP list + organizational hierarchy detection
- [ ] Time sensitivity: Meeting within 24 hours, expiring offers, last call notices
- [ ] High confidence when 2+ indicators present

### AC3: Medium Priority Detection Logic
- [ ] Project updates and team communications
- [ ] Scheduled meetings (>24 hours out)
- [ ] Internal team discussions and collaboration
- [ ] Information requests without urgency
- [ ] Status reports and progress updates
- [ ] Default classification for known senders without urgency signals

### AC4: Low Priority Detection Logic
- [ ] Newsletters and subscription emails
- [ ] Automated notifications (no-reply senders)
- [ ] Marketing and promotional content
- [ ] Social media notifications
- [ ] Bulk mail and distribution lists
- [ ] FYI-only messages with no action required

### AC5: User Correction & Learning System
- [ ] Store user priority corrections in user_corrections table
- [ ] Track correction type: priority_override, sender_importance, category_adjustment
- [ ] Weight recent corrections (last 30 days) more heavily than older ones
- [ ] Update sender importance scores based on correction patterns
- [ ] Learn urgency keyword patterns from user behavior
- [ ] Display correction impact: "Learning from your feedback" toast notification

### AC6: Sender Importance Tracking
- [ ] Calculate sender importance score based on:
  - Email frequency (emails received in last 90 days)
  - User correction history (priority upgrades/downgrades)
  - Reply rate (user replies to this sender)
  - Manual VIP designation by user
- [ ] Store sender_importance in database (0.0 - 1.0 scale)
- [ ] High importance sender (>0.8) â†’ bias toward Higher priority
- [ ] Low importance sender (<0.3) â†’ bias toward Lower priority
- [ ] Recalculate sender scores weekly

### AC7: Visual Priority Indicators
- [ ] Display priority with color-coded emoji indicators:
  - High: ðŸ”´ Red circle
  - Medium: ðŸŸ¡ Yellow circle
  - Low: ðŸ”µ Blue circle
- [ ] Show confidence score on hover/click: "High (92% confident)"
- [ ] Priority badge visible in email list view
- [ ] Large priority indicator in email detail view
- [ ] Consistent color scheme across all UI components

### AC8: Manual Priority Override
- [ ] Allow user to manually change email priority
- [ ] Override UI: Dropdown or button group (High/Medium/Low)
- [ ] Immediately update display after override
- [ ] Store override in user_corrections table for learning
- [ ] Feedback prompt: "Why did you change this?" (optional)
  - "Wrong sender importance"
  - "Urgency misdetected"
  - "Category incorrect"
  - "Other"
- [ ] Apply learning to future emails from same sender

### AC9: Accuracy Tracking & Improvement
- [ ] Track classification accuracy over time
- [ ] Calculate accuracy: (Total - Corrections) / Total
- [ ] Target accuracy: >85% after 30 days of use
- [ ] Display accuracy trend in settings/statistics panel
- [ ] Log accuracy metrics to performance_metrics table
- [ ] Weekly accuracy reports with improvement suggestions

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- Story 1.3 (Real-Time Analysis Engine) - COMPLETE âœ…

**Downstream Dependencies:**
- Story 1.5 (Response Generation) can use priority for response urgency
- Story 2.2 (SQLite Database) provides production database schema
- Story 2.3 (UI) displays priority indicators and override controls
- Story 2.4 (Settings) allows VIP configuration and accuracy viewing

**External Dependencies:**
- SQLite3 (Python stdlib)

**Potential Blockers:**
- User correction rate may be lower than expected (limits learning)
- Sender importance algorithm may need tuning
- Accuracy target (>85%) may require more sophisticated ML

## Questions & Decisions

**Q: How quickly should sender importance scores adapt?**
**A:** Small adjustments (Â±0.05) per correction to avoid overcorrection. Requires 10-20 corrections to significantly change a sender's importance.

**Q: Should we cap the number of corrections stored per sender?**
**A:** Keep last 100 corrections per sender. Archive older corrections for analytics but don't use for real-time learning.

**Q: What if a user never corrects priorities?**
**A:** System defaults to base classification from Story 1.3. Learning is optional enhancement, not required.

**Q: How to handle VIP senders with low-priority emails?**
**A:** VIP flag provides +1 priority adjustment, but obvious newsletters/FYI emails can still be Medium/Low if content clearly indicates it.

**Q: Should we show accuracy metrics to users?**
**A:** Yes, in settings panel. Shows users the system is learning and improving. Gamification element encourages corrections.

**Q: What about privacy concerns with storing sender data?**
**A:** All data stored locally in SQLite. No cloud sync. User controls data deletion. Sender importance is email address + score only, no content.
