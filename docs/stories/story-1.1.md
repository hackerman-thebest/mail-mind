# Story 1.1: Ollama Integration & Model Setup

**Epic:** Epic 1 - AI-Powered Email Intelligence
**Story ID:** 1.1
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Created:** 2025-10-13

## Story Description

As a developer, I need to integrate Ollama for local LLM inference so that the application can run AI models entirely offline on user hardware.

## Business Value

This story establishes the foundational AI infrastructure for MailMind, enabling:
- Complete data privacy through local AI processing
- Zero ongoing API costs for users
- Offline functionality as a core product differentiator
- Hardware flexibility (CPU-only or GPU-accelerated)

Without this story, no AI features can function.

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
- **Ollama:** Must be installed separately on user system
- **Python SDK:** `ollama` package from PyPI
- **Hardware:** Minimum 16GB RAM for Llama 3.1 8B Q4_K_M

### Model Specifications
- **Primary Model:** `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M`
- **Fallback Model:** `mistral:7b-instruct-q4_K_M`
- **Model Size:** ~5GB disk space
- **Quantization:** Q4_K_M (4-bit quantization with k-means)

### Implementation Approach
```python
import ollama

class OllamaManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = None
        self.model_name = "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M"
        self.fallback_model = "mistral:7b-instruct-q4_K_M"

    def connect(self):
        """Establish connection to Ollama service"""
        try:
            self.client = ollama.Client()
            return self.verify_model()
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Ollama connection failed: {e}")
            return False

    def verify_model(self):
        """Check if model is available, download if needed"""
        try:
            models = self.client.list()
            if self.model_name not in [m['name'] for m in models['models']]:
                return self.prompt_model_download()
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Model verification failed: {e}")
            return False

    def test_inference(self):
        """Run test inference to verify model works"""
        try:
            response = self.client.generate(
                model=self.model_name,
                prompt="Test",
                options={"temperature": 0.3, "num_ctx": 8192}
            )
            return response is not None
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Test inference failed: {e}")
            return False
```

### Configuration File (config.yaml)
```yaml
ollama:
  primary_model: "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q4_K_M"
  fallback_model: "mistral:7b-instruct-q4_K_M"
  temperature: 0.3
  context_window: 8192
  auto_download: true
  gpu_acceleration: true
```

## Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test OllamaManager initialization
- [ ] Test connection to Ollama service
- [ ] Test model verification logic
- [ ] Test fallback to Mistral if Llama unavailable
- [ ] Test error handling for missing Ollama

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test with Ollama not installed (should show error)
- [ ] Test with Ollama installed but no model (should prompt download)
- [ ] Test with model already downloaded (should connect immediately)
- [ ] Test inference call with test prompt
- [ ] Test GPU detection and acceleration

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Install fresh on machine without Ollama
- [ ] Verify error message is clear and helpful
- [ ] Install Ollama and restart app
- [ ] Verify model download prompt appears
- [ ] Download model and verify app connects successfully
- [ ] Test on CPU-only machine vs GPU machine
- [ ] Verify performance difference is logged

## Performance Targets

- **Ollama Connection:** <500ms on startup
- **Model Verification:** <1s to check if model exists

## Questions & Decisions

**Q: Should we auto-download the model on first run?**
**A:** No - model is 5GB. Prompt user and let them initiate download with progress indicator.

**Q: What if user has very old hardware?**
**A:** Fallback to Mistral 7B. If still insufficient, show clear hardware requirements message.

**Q: Should we support other models (e.g., Gemma, Phi)?**
**A:** Not in MVP. Focus on Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7B fallback only.
