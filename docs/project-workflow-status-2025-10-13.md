## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** desktop (Desktop Application)
- **Project Level:** 2
- **Instruction Set:** Medium Project (Multiple Epics)
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** greenfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** MailMind - Sovereign AI Email Assistant (privacy-first, local LLM-powered email management)
- **Estimated Stories:** 12 stories (72 story points)
- **Estimated Epics:** 2 epics (AI Engine + Desktop App)
- **Timeline:** 8 weeks MVP (4 sprints of 2 weeks each)

### Context

- **Has UI Components:** Yes (UX workflow included in Phase 2)
- **Phase 1 (Analysis):** Skipped - proceeding directly to planning
- **Phase 3 (Solutioning):** Skipped - not required for Level 2 projects
- **Team Size:** Individual/Small Team
- **Deployment Intent:** TBD

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 2 Outputs:**
- Product Requirements Document (PRD) or Tech Spec
- UX Specification (wireframes, user flows, component library)
- Epic breakdown
- Story backlog

**Phase 4 Outputs:**
- Individual story files (story-1.1.md, story-1.2.md, etc.)
- Story context XML files
- Implemented features
- Completed stories

### Workflow Sequence

1. **Phase 2: Planning**
   - Start with `plan-project` (PM agent) to create PRD and epic/story breakdown
   - Follow with `ux-spec` (PM agent) to define UI/UX requirements

2. **Phase 4: Implementation** (iterative)
   - SM creates story drafts using `create-story`
   - User reviews and approves with `story-ready`
   - SM generates context with `story-context`
   - DEV implements with `dev-story`
   - User reviews and marks done with `story-approved`
   - Repeat for all stories in backlog

### Next Actions

**Immediate next step:** Load PM agent and run `plan-project` workflow

This will:
- Assess your project requirements
- Generate appropriate planning document (PRD/Tech-Spec)
- Break down project into epics and stories
- Populate the story backlog for Phase 4

## Special Considerations

- **UI Components:** Project includes user interface - UX workflow is mandatory before implementation
- **Level 2 Project:** Multiple epics expected, but no architectural phase needed
- **Greenfield:** Starting from scratch - no existing codebase documentation needed

## Technical Preferences Captured

**From PRD Analysis:**
- **Platform:** Windows Desktop Application (Windows 10/11)
- **UI Framework:** CustomTkinter (modern, themed UI)
- **Email Integration:** pywin32 (COM automation for Outlook) ‚Üí Microsoft Graph API (v2.0 roadmap)
- **AI Engine:** Ollama + Llama 3.1 8B (Q4_K_M quantized)
- **Database:** SQLite3 with optional encryption
- **Language:** Python
- **Hardware Target:** 16GB RAM minimum, GPU recommended for optimal performance
- **Architecture:** Offline-first with zero network calls for core features
- **Deployment:** One-time purchase ($149), installer with code signing

## Story Naming Convention

### Level 2 (Multiple Epics)

- **Format:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`
- **Example:** `story-1.1.md`, `story-1.2.md`, `story-2.1.md`
- **Location:** `docs/stories/`
- **Max Stories:** Per epic breakdown in planning documents
