**Author:** Dawson
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Project Level:** 2
**Target Scale:** 5-15 stories, 1-2 epics, focused PRD + solutioning handoff

---

## Epic Overview

MailMind is a Sovereign AI Email Assistant - a privacy-first desktop application that provides AI-powered email intelligence without sending data to the cloud. The MVP consists of four main epics:

0. **Epic 0: Setup & Reliability** - Build bulletproof installation with automatic resource detection, model selection, and self-healing diagnostics (Week 0-1, foundational)
1. **Epic 1: AI-Powered Email Intelligence** - Build the local LLM engine for real-time email analysis, response generation, and smart categorization
2. **Epic 2: Desktop Application & User Experience** - Create the Windows desktop application with Outlook integration, modern UI, and seamless onboarding
3. **Epic 3: Security & MVP Readiness** - Address security vulnerabilities and align marketing with implementation reality

**Development Timeline:** 9 weeks MVP (1 week Epic 0 + 8 weeks main epics)
**Target Users:** Privacy-conscious professionals (developers, executives, journalists, lawyers)
**Key Differentiator:** Absolute privacy through local AI processing with one-time purchase model

---

## Epic Details

### Epic 0: Setup & Reliability

**Epic Goal:** Build a bulletproof installation and diagnostic system that automatically detects system resources, selects appropriate AI models, and provides automated troubleshooting for common issues - ensuring 90%+ of users can successfully set up MailMind without manual intervention.

**Value Proposition:** Ensure users can actually install and run the product before they see the main features - addressing critical real-world blockers discovered during testing.

**Success Criteria:**
- Setup success rate >90% (currently ~30%)
- Model selection accuracy >95% (users get models that work on their systems)
- Diagnostic auto-fix rate >80% (issues resolved without manual steps)
- Time to first success <5 minutes
- Zero Unicode errors in diagnostics

**Key Stories:**
- Story 0.1: System Resource Detection & Model Recommendation (3 pts)
- Story 0.2: Interactive Model Selection in Setup Wizard (5 pts)
- Story 0.3: Unicode Error Fixes & Robust Subprocess Handling (2 pts)
- Story 0.4: Interactive Diagnostic Remediation Menu (5 pts)
- Story 0.5: Dynamic Model Loading & Runtime Switching (3 pts) - Nice to have

**Total Epic Points:** 18 points (excluding 0.5)
**Critical Path Points:** 10 points (Stories 0.1, 0.2, 0.3)

**Why This Epic Exists:**
Real-world testing revealed installation failures on 8GB RAM systems:
- 45-second timeout errors (model too large for system)
- Unicode decode crashes (Windows encoding issues)
- No resource-aware setup (assumes all users have 16GB+ RAM)
- Manual troubleshooting required (poor UX)

Without this epic, 50-70% of users will fail during setup and abandon the product.
